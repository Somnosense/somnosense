    <h1>Somnosense</h1>
    <h4>Intraoral Sleep Apnea Sensor Patch</h4>
    <p>We are CtrlZZZ, a team brought together by a shared goal: to make sleep health diagnostics accessible to high-risk individuals worldwide seeking answers about their sleep.
    </p>

    <p>Sleep apnea is one of the most common yet most dangerous sleep disorders in the world. More than one billion people worldwide suffer from it, but research shows that nearly 90% of cases go undetected and undiagnosed due to costly and uncomfortable overnight sleep lab tests. This lack of access to early diagnosis leads to increased cardiovascular risk, other dangerous disorders, and significantly reduced quality of life.</p>

    <p>Somnosense is a flexible and biocompatible intraoral sensor patch that enables accurate, comfortable at-home screening for sleep apnea. By combining physical and biochemical sensing, the system captures physiological signals that traditional at-home tests ignore. Data is processed through a smartphone application to generate clinical-level sleep reports in familiar, comfortable environments.</p>
