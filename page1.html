  <h2 class="header">Our Mission</h2>
  <p>o increase access to early sleep apnea screening through a comfortable, non-invasive intraoral diagnostic system designed for at-home use.

    We aim to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduce barriers such as cost, discomfort, and long wait times</li>
        <li>Enable screening for individuals who cannot tolerate traditional sleep studies</li>
        <li>Support earlier intervention and improved long-term health outcomes</li>
    </ul>
<br>
    <h2 class="header">Our Vision</h2>
    <p>We envision a future where sleep apnea screening is simple, affordable, and widely accessible, rather than limited to specialized clinical environments.

        SomnoSense is designed as a scalable diagnostic platform, progressing from a validated intraoral prototype to a fully miniaturized, biocompatible patch integrated with intelligent data analysis. By combining physical airflow-related signals with biochemical indicators from the oral environment, we aim to bridge the gap between consumer wearables and clinical diagnostics.</p>
<br>
    <h2 class="header">Our Values</h2>
    <b>Accessibility</b>
    <p>Designing solutions that prioritize comfort, affordability, and ease of use.</p>
    <b>Scientific Integrity</b>
    <p>Clearly distinguishing validated functionality from future development while maintaining transparency.</p>
    <b>Human-Centered Design</b>
    <p>Building technology around patient experience and real clinical needs.</p>
    <b>Responsible Innovation</b>
    <p>Advancing scalable and ethical medical technology without unnecessary complexity.</p>
